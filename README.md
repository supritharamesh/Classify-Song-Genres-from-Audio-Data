# Classify-Song-Genres-from-Audio-Data
Over the last few years, streaming services with large catalogs have surpassed CDs as the primary way for the majority of people to listen to music. At the same time, the sheer volume of music available might leave people feeling overwhelmed while searching for contemporary music that fits their tastes.

As a result, streaming services have investigated methods of categorizing music in order to provide individualized suggestions. One way involves performing a direct analysis of the raw audio data included in a given song and assigning a score to the raw data based on a variety of measures. Today, we'll look at data produced by The Echo Nest, a study organization. Our objective is to sift through this dataset and categorize songs as 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' - all without listening to a single one. Thus, we will learn how to cleanse our data, conduct exploratory data visualization, and employ feature reduction in order to input our data into some rudimentary machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and logistic regression.
